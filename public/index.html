    <p class="intro-text">
      Every four years, millions of Americans come together to cast their votes and choose the next President
      of the United States.
      However, the full process of selecting candidates, collecting votes, and determining a winner
      is a lot more intricate than a simple majority rule.
      We aim to educate our viewers, both beginners and experts alike, on the entire election process
      from beginning to end.
      By providing a clear overview of the underlying mechanisms that make our democracy work, we hope to empower
      our viewers to get more involved in the democratic process, and build a cohesive framework for
      understanding important real-world political events.
      <br> <br>
      In this exploratory visualization, we are going to explore all key aspects of the US Presidential Election,
      from the Primaries, the Electoral College, the Election Day, and finally the Inauguration.
      To provide a backdrop for this journey, we'll be seeing how each of these core components factored into the
      2020 election.

        The 2020 presidential election in the United States was a pivotal moment that resonated globally. Against a
        backdrop of intense political polarization, socio-economic upheaval, and the enduring effects of a worldwide
        pandemic, this election stood as a defining crossroads for the nation.
        The incumbent, President Donald Trump, sought re-election, championing a platform of
        economic growth, conservative policies, and a promise to restore America's greatness. Opposing him was former Vice
        President Joe Biden, advocating for unity, social justice, healthcare reform, and a comprehensive approach to
        combating the COVID-19 crisis.

        The election was conducted amidst unprecedented challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which altered the
        dynamics of traditional campaigning, prompting increased reliance on virtual communication and mail-in voting.
        Moreover, concerns about the integrity of the electoral process added to the tension, leading to intense scrutiny
        and debate over mail-in ballots, voter suppression, and the overall reliability of the election results.

      <h1>The Primaries</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="section hidden">
      <p class="intro-text">
        The presidential primaries are a crucial component of the United States' democratic process, serving as a means
        for political parties to select their respective
        candidates for the presidency. Primary elections occur in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
        territories.
        <br> <br>
        The goal of each primary is to accumulate delegates for a particular candidate. Delegates are individuals chosen
        to represent their state/territory at the party's
        national convention, where a candidate will officially be nominated for the presidency. The number of delegates in
        each state are determined by population and political
        significance, and are assigned to candidates based on the percentage of votes received. The ultimate goal of the
        primary process is to secure a majority of delegates
        needed to become the party's nominee for president.
        <br> <br>
        In 2020, both Democrats and Republicans hosted primaries, however we will focus only on the Democratic Primaries
        since the Republicans had an incumbent president running in Donald Trump. Trump won all 56 of the Republican
        Primaries,
        taking nearly 94% of the votes.
        <br> <br>
        The Democratic Party Presidential Primaries and Caucuses took place from February 3rd to August 11th. A total of
        3,979 pledged delegates were selected to the 2020 Democratic
        National Convention held from August 17th to 20th. A total of 29 major candidates declared their candidacies, the

  <!-- ###################################### THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ###################################### -->

<div id="electoral-section">
  <div class="section title-div hidden">
    <h1>The Electoral College</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="section hidden">
    <p class="intro-text">
      Once the Democrat and Republican candidates are chosen in the primaries, it's time for them to begin campaigning.
      On Election Day, the country comes together to choose the president for the next four years,
      but it's not quite as simple as a popular vote.
      To win the election, one candidate must win more electoral college votes than their opponent. But what does that
      mean, exactly?
      <br><br>
      The Electoral College is a system used in the United States to determine the outcome of presidential elections.
      Rather than electing the president directly through a popular vote, the Electoral College involves a process
      where each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress. These
      electors,
      equal to the number of senators and representatives a state has, then cast their votes for the president.
      <br><br>
      Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol class="intro-text">
      <li>
        <strong>Allocation of Electors:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          Each state has a set number of electors, which is determined by the total number of senators (always two per
          state)
          plus the number of representatives in the House (based on the state's population).
          For example, Washington has 2 delegates in the Senate and 10 delegates in the House of Representatives,
          so Washington has 12 electors.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Winner-Takes-All (in Most States):</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          Most states follow a "winner-takes-all" system, where the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state gets
          all of its electoral votes. However, Maine and Nebraska allocate their electoral votes based on the winner of
          each congressional district.
          Also, sometimes electors don't vote for the party that wins the state's popular vote.
          Electors who do this are called "faithless electors," but they've never swung a presidential election in the
          past.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>270 Electoral Votes:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure a majority of the electoral votes, which is currently
          270 out of 538 total electors. If no candidate reaches this majority, the House of Representatives decides
          the outcome from the top three candidates.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meeting of Electors:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          After the general election, typically in December, the electors meet in their respective states to cast
          their votes for president and vice president. These votes are then transmitted to Congress to be
          officially counted and certified.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Congressional Confirmation:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          In January, during a joint session of Congress, the electoral votes are counted and officially confirmed.
          The candidate who receives at least 270 electoral votes is declared the winner and becomes the next president.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <br>
    <p class="intro-text">
      An interesting facet of the electoral college is that it allows for states with lower populations
      (and therefore fewer representatives in the House) to have a proportionally higher impact on the election
      compared to what the popular vote might suggest. Let's visualize why this is the case:
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="electoralplaygroundwrapper">
  <div class="section">
    <div id="electoralexplanation">

      <div class="button-container">
        <button id="electorsButton">Electors</button>
        <button id="populationButton">Population</button>
        <button id="ratioButton">Ratio E/P</button>
      </div>

      <div id="electorsDisplay">Displaying: Map of State Electors</div>

      <div id="electoralmap"></div>
      <div id="tooltip" class="electoralmap-tooltip"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="intro-text">
      The ratio of electors to population essentially illustrates the "strength" of a single person's vote in a given
      state.
      As illustrated in the visualization above, this sometimes has fairly dramatic implications - a vote from a Wyoming
      resident
      is worth nearly 4 times as much as a vote from a Californian.
      <br> <br>
      This situation has benefits and detriments - while detractors claim that it goes against the democratic spirit,
      proponents
      claim that it allows for rural representation when urban dwellers are detached from important issues in sparsely
      populated areas.
      Regardless of individual views, the electoral college is currently an essential facet of the presidential election
      process, and one
      that is worth thoroughly understanding.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section hidden" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p class="intro-text">
      Swing states, also known as battleground states or purple states, play a crucial role in determining
      the outcome of elections, especially in the context of the Electoral College system in the United States.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="intro-text">
      These states are termed "swing" because they don't consistently vote for a particular political party.
      Their significance lies in their ability to potentially tip the balance of electoral votes in favor of one
      candidate or another.
      <br><br>
      Several factors contribute to a state being labeled a swing state:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul class="intro-text">
      <li>
        <strong>Narrow Margins:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          Swing states often have a relatively even split between voters affiliated with different political parties.
          This balance makes their electoral votes highly contested, as even small shifts in voter preferences can sway
          the results.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diverse Demographics:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          These states often represent a broad spectrum of demographics, including urban and rural areas, different
          ethnicities,
          income levels, and education backgrounds. As a result, they reflect a more diverse range of political opinions
          and interests.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Historical Voting Patterns:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          While swing states may have leaned toward a particular party in the past, their allegiance can change over
          time due to evolving demographics, shifting policy priorities, or changes in party platforms.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Swing states are crucial in election campaigns because winning them can significantly impact a candidate's
      path to securing the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. Consequently, these states receive
      heightened attention and campaign resources from candidates seeking to sway undecided voters or secure a marginal
      advantage.
      Candidates often tailor their policies, messaging, and campaign strategies to appeal specifically to voters in
      these swing
      states, recognizing the potential to win over crucial electoral votes that could make or break their chances of
      winning the presidency.

    <h1>Election Day</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="intro-text">
      The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is Election Day: in 2020, that day was November 3rd.
      <br><br>
      On the day of the election, people from across the country submit their ballots and the tallies begin - but
      of course, it's a bit more complicated than that. 
      <br><br>
      There are four main types of votes cast during the presidential election:
      <br><br>
    </p>

    <ul class="intro-text">
      <li>
        <strong>Absentee:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          This type of voting allows voters to cast their ballot by mail or in person before the election day. 
          It's primarily designed for those who cannot be present at their polling place on the day of the election,
          for reasons such as being out of the country or having a disability. 
          Voters usually need to request an absentee ballot before a specified deadline.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Early:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          Early voting allows voters to cast their ballots in person at a designated polling place before the official election day.
          The timeframe for early voting can vary from a few days to several weeks, depending on the jurisdiction.
          This method is designed to increase voter participation and reduce congestion at polling places on election day.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Election Day:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          This is the standard form of voting, where voters go to their assigned polling place on the day of the election.
          They cast their ballot in person, usually via electronic voting machines, punch cards, or paper ballots.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Provisional:</strong>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">
          Provisional ballots are used when there's some question about a voter's eligibility. 
          This could happen if the voter's name is not on the electoral roll, if they don't have proper identification,
          or if they've moved and didn't update their voter registration. Provisional ballots are kept separate from regular ballots. 
          After the election, election officials determine the voter's eligibility, and if eligible, the vote is counted.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Each of these voting methods is an integral part of the electoral process, offering flexibility and ensuring
      that as many eligible voters as possible have the opportunity to participate in elections.

    <p class="intro-text">
      Due to the multitude of voting options available to the American public, and due to the fact that there are over 100 million 
      votes cast every single election, it can often take a while to get the full count. In many states, absentee and provisional ballots 
      an be received several days after the election, as long as they are postmarked by election day - significantly extending the tallying process.
      Additionally, some states may also have recount laws that automatically trigger a recount if the margin of victory is within a certain percentage.
      <br> <br>
      Once the vote-counting process in a given state is completed (a process which might take weeks), the state will be officially called in favor of
      a candidate. While the media might show projections on Election Day regarding winners for each state, this information is based off incomplete data,
      as many of the votes have yet to be counted. In close races, especially in swing states, media outlets might be especially cautious about prematurely 
      calling a state for a candidate. 
      In some states, where the margin of victory for a given candidate is high enough, the winner can be easily
      predicted, but even then, the legal process of calling a state will not occur until several weeks after the election. 
      <br> <br>
      Once a state is called, its electoral votes will be awarded to the candidate that won the popular vote there.
      Let's take a look at which states each 2020 candidate won, and which states made the difference.

      Once all the individual votes are counted, the states certify the results, and the electors cast their votes,
      the Electoral College results are sent to Congress to be officially counted during a joint session in the 
      first week of January. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="intro-text">
      The winner of the presidential election is officially declared during the joint congressional setting - whichever candidate
      gets at least 270 out of the 538 available electoral votes is the new President-elect. On Inauguration Day (January 20th/21st if the 20th
      falls on a Sunday), the new President of the United States is sworn into office.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="intro-text">
      The office of the President in the United States is perhaps the most powerful position any individual can attain in the modern world.
      To ensure that anyone who ascends to such high office is up to the task of representing the American people, a long series of events
      take place, giving every American citizen of voting age a chance to participate in one of the world's largest democratic processes. 
      While the system may seem confusing at times, and while there are certainly flaws, a thorough understanding of the component elements
      can go a long way towards ensuring that our democracy continues to operate smoothly - a goal that everyone, on both sides of the aisle,
      can hope to strive for.
